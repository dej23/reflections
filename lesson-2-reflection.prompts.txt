What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It starts a .git folder which will start to keep track of meta data needed for version controls

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

it is a middle ground between the two locations. good for posturing changes before fully committing
